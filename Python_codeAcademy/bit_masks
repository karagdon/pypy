# BIT MASK #

# A bit mask is just a variable that aids you with bitwise operations. A bit mask can help you turn specific bits on, turn others off, or just collect data from an integer about which bits are on or off.

# num  = 0b1100
# mask = 0b0100
# desired = num & mask
# if desired > 0:
#    print "Bit was on"

def check_bit4(input):
    mask = 0b1000
    num = input
    result ="on"
    desired = num & mask
    if desired < 1:
        result = "off"
    return result
